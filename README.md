#### How does RssWave convert text to audio?
RssWave uses a combination of Gemini AI for text processing and ElevenLabs for voice synthesis. The platform first processes your RSS feed content through Gemini AI to optimize it for audio conversion, then uses ElevenLabs' advanced text-to-speech technology to create natural-sounding audio.

#### Can I customize the voice and speed of the audio?
Yes! RssWave offers multiple voice options powered by ElevenLabs AI. You can select different voices and adjust playback speeds to match your preferences. The platform provides full control over voice selection and audio playback settings.

#### Is there a limit to how many RSS feeds I can add?
No, there's no limit to the number of RSS feeds you can add to your RssWave account. You can convert articles from any number of RSS feeds into audio format, making it easy to build your personal audio library from multiple sources.

#### Do I need to provide my own API keys?
Yes, RssWave requires you to provide your own Gemini and ElevenLabs API keys for security and billing purposes. This ensures you have full control over your usage and costs. You can easily add these API keys in your dashboard settings.

#### Can I listen to my audio content offline?
Currently, RssWave requires an internet connection to stream your audio content. However, you can access your converted articles from any device with an internet connection, and the audio plays without any advertisements or interruptions.
